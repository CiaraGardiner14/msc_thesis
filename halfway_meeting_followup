Ground-based delivery robot equipped with risk-based triggering have the strongest chances of self-preservation when being pursued by an air-borne drone if they are capable of accurately assessing the risk levels of a given situation and continuously dynamically reassessing the interaction throughout.

The most effective means by which a delivery robot can avoid capture and achieve their goal is by combining fleeing with refuge seeking during their escape.
